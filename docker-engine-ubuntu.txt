----------------Install Docker Engine on Ubuntu-----------------

Step 1. Uninstall old versions
        ## Older versions of Docker were called docker, docker.io, or docker-engine. If these are installed, uninstall them:

        $ sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc
        

----------------Set up the repository---------------------------

Step 2. Update the apt package index and install packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS:

        $ sudo apt-get update
        
        $ sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release
        
        
Step 3. Add Dockerâ€™s official GPG key:

        $ curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
        
        
---------------Install Docker Engine----------------------------

Step 4. Update the apt package index
        
        $ sudo apt-get update

Step 5. install the latest version of Docker Engine, containerd, and Docker Compose, or go to the next step to install a specific version:

        $ sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose-plugin
        
Step 6. Verify that Docker Engine is installed correctly by running the hello-world image.

        $ sudo docker run hello-world
        
        This command downloads a test image and runs it in a container. When the container runs, it prints a message and exits.
        
Docker Engine is installed and running. The docker group is created but no users are added to it. You need to use sudo to run Docker commands. 
Continue to Linux postinstall to allow non-privileged users to run Docker commands and for other optional configuration steps.


==========================================Post-installation steps for Linux==========================================

Step 7. Add your user to the docker group.

        $ sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
        
Log out and log back in so that your group membership is re-evaluated.

Step 8. On Linux, you can also run the following command to activate the changes to groups:

        $ newgrp docker
        
Step 9. Verify that you can run docker commands without sudo.

        $ docker run hello-world
        
        
===============================Configure Docker to start on boot========================

Most current Linux distributions (RHEL, CentOS, Fedora, Debian, Ubuntu 16.04 and higher) use systemd to manage which services start when the system boots. 
On Debian and Ubuntu, the Docker service is configured to start on boot by default. To automatically start Docker and Containerd on boot for other distros, use the commands below:

 $ sudo systemctl enable docker.service
 $ sudo systemctl enable containerd.service
